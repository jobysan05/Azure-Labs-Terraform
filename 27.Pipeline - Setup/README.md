## Here are some more detailed steps for setting up your Azure Pipeline to run Terraform:


1. Create an Azure DevOps project:
Sign in to your Azure DevOps account https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines/ and click on "Create Project" to create a new project.
Give your project a name and select a visibility level (public or private).
Choose a version control system for your code. For this example, we'll use GitHub.
Click "Create" to create your project.

2. Set up your repository:
In your new project, go to the "Repos" tab.
Click "Import" to import your Terraform code into the repository. You can import from a URL or from a local Git repository.
Once your code is imported, you can view it in the repository.


3. Configure your pipeline:
In your project, go to the "Pipelines" tab and click "New pipeline".
Make sure to use the classic editor to create a pipeline without YAML for now.
Select the repository that contains your Terraform code.
Start with an empty job for template
Set up your  tasks as required.
When configuring the "Terraform" task, download the terraform task from Marketplace select the version of Terraform you want to use and specify the path to your Terraform code.

4. Test and run your pipeline:
Click "Save and run" to save your pipeline and run a test build.
Monitor the build logs to ensure that your Terraform code is being correctly validated and that the pipeline is running successfully.
If this is the first time, Pipeline is being run, fill out the form https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request to request access. Please note that it takes 2-3 business days to get approved.
Once you're approved. Test that everything is working as expected, you can then run the pipeline to create your Azure resources.
That's it! With these steps, you should now have an Azure Pipeline set up to run Terraform for the first time.
